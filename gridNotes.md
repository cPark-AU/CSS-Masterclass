<h3>grid</h3>

grid is similar to flexbox where we want to always talk to the parent element to change what happens to the children elements.

<b>[ grid-template-columns: 20px 55px 89px 100px; ] </b> - This is used to change the width of elements. We can change the number of columns in a row by adding or removing values. <i>auto</i> can be used to fill up the maximum space of the screen.

<b>[ grid-template-rows: 100px 50px 300px; ] </b> - This is used to change height of elements. We can also use <i>repeat(3, 200px)</i> to repeat the same values.

<b>[ column-gap: row-gap: gap: ]</b> - The column-gap and row-gap provide a gap for its respective name and gap is used for both column and row

<b>[ grid-template-areas: ] </b> - We tell the class for the grid-template-areas what they are ( grid-area: header; ) for grid-template-areas to know what it is dealing with.
