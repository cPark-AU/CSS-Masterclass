<h3><b>Flexbox</b></h3>

The container for flexbox is the parent and the content inside are the children. 

In flexbox, there are two axes, one is the main-axis (horizontal) and the other is the cross-axis (vertical).

The default flex-direction of flexbox is row (horizontal) and to change the location of the children, 
justify-content is used and for columns (vertical), align-items is used.

<b>flex-directon: row;</b>  (the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical)

<b>flex-direction: column;</b> (the main axis is vertical and the cross axis is horizontal)

When using <b>[ align-items: center; ]</b> make sure the height of the container is higher than the boxes inside.

Once the height is assigned to the container, we can observe that the boxes are aligned to the center of
the cross axis.

<b><i>align-items</i></b>

<b>[ align-items: flex-end; ]</b>- places items on the end of the cross axis

<b>[ align-items: flex-start; ]</b> - places items on the start of the cross axis (default)

<b>[ align-items: center; ]</b> - places items on the center of the cross axis
